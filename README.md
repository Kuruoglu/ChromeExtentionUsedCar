# Inventory Highlighter ‚Äî Chrome Extension

Inventory Highlighter dims and labels sold vehicles directly on dealership inventory pages by cross-checking VIN and Stock numbers against a Google Sheet. It supports both published CSV feeds and the Google Sheets API, and works on infinite-scroll listings.

## Features

- üîÑ **Sheet sync** ‚Äì Fetches data from either a published CSV URL or the Google Sheets API.
- üöó **VIN / Stock matching** ‚Äì Normalises VINs and stock numbers, then builds fast lookup sets.
- ‚ú® **Visual treatments** ‚Äì Adds a `Sold` badge and dims matching vehicle cards. Optionally hides them entirely.
- ‚ôæÔ∏è **Infinite scroll aware** ‚Äì MutationObserver and debounced rescans keep lazy-loaded cards accurate.
- üß∞ **Customisable** ‚Äì Options page lets you adjust column names, selectors, sold values, badge text, and refresh cadence.
- üß≠ **Popup controls** ‚Äì One-click refresh, hide-sold toggle, and last-sync timestamp.

## Getting Started

1. **Download / Clone** ‚Äì Grab this repository.
2. **Provide icons** ‚Äì Create simple PNG icons at 16px, 48px, and 128px named `icon-16.png`, `icon-48.png`, and `icon-128.png` in an `assets/` folder if you want custom branding.
3. **Load unpacked** ‚Äì In Chrome visit `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer Mode, click **Load unpacked**, and pick this folder.
4. **Configure options** ‚Äì Right-click the extension ‚Üí **Options**. Fill in your data source and selectors (see below).
5. **Visit an inventory page** ‚Äì The extension will dim and label sold vehicles automatically.

## Data Source Setup

### Option A: Published CSV (recommended for simplicity)

1. Open your Google Sheet.
2. Choose **File ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Publish to web** and select **Comma-separated values (.csv)**.
3. Copy the generated URL.
4. Paste it into **Options ‚Üí Published CSV URL**.

### Option B: Google Sheets API (for private sheets)

1. Enable the Google Sheets API in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com).
2. Create an API key (restrict it to the Sheets API if possible).
3. Note your Spreadsheet ID (from the sheet URL) and the range containing your data, e.g. `Sheet1!A1:C500`.
4. In Options fill **Spreadsheet ID**, **Range**, and **API Key**. Leave CSV URL blank.

## Configuring Columns & Status Values

Your sheet must contain the VIN, Stock, and Status columns (case-insensitive). Match the column headers in Options. Add all possible sold-status strings (comma-separated) such as:

```
Sold,SOLD,Delivered,–ü—Ä–æ–¥–∞–Ω–æ
```

Rows whose status matches any of these values will be treated as sold.

## Selector Customisation

By default the extension targets many Dealer Inspire‚Äìstyle layouts:

- Card selector: `.vehicle-card, .inventory-card, .result-item, .vehicle`
- VIN selector: `[data-vehicle-vin], [data-vin], .vin`
- Stock selector: `[data-vehicle-stock], [data-stock], .stock`

If your site uses different markup, update the selectors in Options. Use CSS selectors that resolve relative to each vehicle card.

## Popup Controls

- **Refresh now** ‚Äì Forces a data fetch via the background service worker.
- **Hide sold** ‚Äì Toggles visibility of matched cards (persists per browser profile).
- **Last sync** ‚Äì Displays the timestamp of the last successful fetch.

## Styling Hooks

- `.ih-sold` ‚Äì Applied to sold cards (dims via filter).
- `.ih-badge` ‚Äì Badge element appended inside the card.
- `.ih-hidden` ‚Äì Applied when hide-sold is enabled.

You can override these classes with custom CSS using a user style manager if desired.

## Permissions

- `storage` ‚Äì Save configuration and cached sheet data.
- `alarms` ‚Äì Schedule periodic refreshes.
- `host_permissions` ‚Äì Default includes Google Sheets endpoints and `<all_urls>` for the content script. Restrict hosts before publishing to the Chrome Web Store.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Options save and reload correctly.
- [ ] CSV fetch works with a demo sheet (VIN `JM3KK1WY0R1100001`, Status `Sold`).
- [ ] Sheets API fetch works with API credentials.
- [ ] Visiting an inventory page dims/badges sold vehicles.
- [ ] Lazy-loaded cards are annotated after scrolling.
- [ ] Popup **Refresh now** updates last sync without reloading the page.
- [ ] Hide sold toggle in the popup hides/unhides cards instantly.

## Packaging & Deployment

1. Update **host_permissions** in `manifest.json` to the exact dealership domains you support.
2. Run through the testing checklist above.
3. Add your own PNG icons (16/48/128px) before publishing, then zip the entire folder and upload to the Chrome Web Store developer dashboard.
